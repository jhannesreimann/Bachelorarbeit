   * Implementations should verify the identifier and credential pair using
   * their chosen mechanism. Typical steps include input validation, hashing,
   * salting, and comparison against stored hashes, or delegation to an
   * external authentication service. Invalid or malformed inputs should be
   * handled gracefully by returning {@code false} rather than throwing
   * exceptions, unless a system error occurs.

   *               a password or authentication token); must not be {@code null} or empty
   * @return {@code true} if the credentials are valid and authentication succeeds;
